# Segmentation and Classification of Wheat Leaves for Rust Detection


**Dataset is Available at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1crUqRpSUH0oqVN5-s7W6HfZeztW2VKB4?usp=sharing)**

- **Segmentation** folder has code for the segmentation techniques used in the study, namely u2net, watershed and grabcut.
- **Inference** folder has the trained ResNet18 model along with code for inferencing images for detecting rust in wheat leaves
- **Training and Validation** folder has the code used to consolodate the results on an open source dataset. The open source dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olyadgetch/wheat-leaf-dataset)
